You can run this script as a kubernetes job or cronjob.  See cronjob-yaml for an example K8 cronjob implementation.  You should be able to install it with "kubectl -n nirmata apply -f cronjob-yaml".

Note that you will need to change the namespace in the above command and the yaml files in cronjob-yaml if your namespace is not nirmata.

Also you need to edit the cronjob-yaml/cronjob-nirmata-test.yaml file to:
- use the right smtp server
- use your email address
- use your username
- use your password

I recommend setting schedule: to "0 0 0 0 0" for testing.  Just be sure not to leave it running like that for long.

Finally you''l want to remove --always-email once you are sure things work.
